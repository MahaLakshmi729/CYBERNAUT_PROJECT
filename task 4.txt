What is transformers in machine learning?
Transformers are a type of artificial neural
 network architecture that is used to solve 
the problem of transduction or transformation 
of input sequences into output sequences in 
deep learning applications

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) 
and machine learning (ML) that involves training agents to learn from the 
environment through trial-and-error interactions, in order to maximize a 
cumulative reward signal.
In RL, an agent interacts with an environment to learn how to take actions
that lead to the desired outcomes. The agent receives feedback from the 
environment in the form of rewards or punishments, which are used to adjust 
the agent's behavior. The agent learns by taking actions, observing the outcomes, 
and adjusting its behavior based on the rewards received.
The goal of RL is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative 
reward over time. The policy is a mapping of states to actions that the agent 
should take in order to achieve the desired outcome. RL algorithms use various 
techniques, such as value-based methods, policy-based methods, and model-based methods, 
to learn this optimal policy.
RL has been applied to a wide range of applications, including game playing, robotics,
natural language processing, recommendation systems, and more. It has shown great 
success in solving complex problems where traditional programming methods are not effective.

Pre-trained model
A pre-trained model is a machine learning model that has already been trained on a 
large dataset and is then made available for others to use for their own tasks. 
Pre-trained models can be used to speed up the process of training a new model or
to improve the accuracy of an existing model.
